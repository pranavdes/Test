  <h1>Account Verification QA Review – RACI and Escalation Plan (Powai CoE Migration)</h1>

  <h2>Overview</h2>
  <p>The Account Verification QA Review is a quality assurance process established to ensure that the account verification procedures meet the required standards and compliance. With the migration of this process to the Powai Center of Excellence (CoE), it is critical to clearly define roles, responsibilities, and escalation paths to maintain efficiency and accountability. This document provides an overview of the RACI (Responsible, Accountable, Consulted, Informed) matrix for each step in the QA review process, outlines various escalation scenarios, and offers recommendations to enhance visibility, process controls, and ownership.</p>
  <p>By defining a clear RACI and escalation plan, the team can ensure that every stage of the QA review is properly managed and that any issues encountered are promptly addressed by the appropriate stakeholders. The ultimate goal is to uphold the quality of the account verification process during and after the transition to the Powai CoE, minimizing disruptions and maintaining compliance with all relevant guidelines.</p>

  <h2>RACI Matrix for AV QAR Process Steps</h2>
  <p>The following RACI matrix defines the responsibilities of each stakeholder at key steps of the Account Verification QA Review (AV QAR) process. RACI stands for:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>R – Responsible:</strong> The individual or team who performs the work for that step.</li>
    <li><strong>A – Accountable:</strong> The person ultimately answerable for the correct completion of the step and who delegates the work.</li>
    <li><strong>C – Consulted:</strong> Individuals or teams whose input is sought (typically subject-matter experts) for that step.</li>
    <li><strong>I – Informed:</strong> Individuals or teams who are kept informed about the step’s progress or outcomes.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Key stakeholders in this process include the QA Analyst (Powai CoE), the QA Team Lead/Manager, the Account Verification Process Owner (from the business unit), and the Operations Team Lead for Account Verification. The matrix below clarifies each of their roles throughout the QA review process:</p>

  <h2>Escalation Scenarios and Flows</h2>
  <p>Different levels of issues require different escalation paths. The following scenarios outline how the team should respond to findings from the QA review, detailing who needs to be involved and informed at each escalation level:</p>

  <h3>Scenario 1: Minor Issues – Handled at Team Level</h3>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Trigger:</strong> The QA Analyst finds minor discrepancies or isolated errors that do not pose significant risk or compliance issues.</li>
    <li><strong>Initial Action:</strong> QA Analyst discusses the findings directly with the Operations Team Lead and the team members involved, providing immediate feedback and clarification.</li>
    <li><strong>Resolution:</strong> The Operations Team Lead ensures the team corrects the errors (for example, by re-verifying the affected accounts or coaching the team on proper procedures).</li>
    <li><strong>Follow-Up:</strong> QA Analyst verifies in the next review cycle that the issues have been resolved. No further escalation is required as long as the problems do not recur.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Scenario 2: Major Findings – Escalation to Process Owner</h3>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Trigger:</strong> Significant issues are identified (e.g., a pattern of errors, potential compliance concerns, or multiple failures in the verification process) that could impact operations or compliance.</li>
    <li><strong>Initial Action:</strong> QA Analyst reports the major findings to the QA Team Lead/Manager immediately. Together, they categorize the issue as high-priority.</li>
    <li><strong>Escalation:</strong> The QA Team Lead/Manager notifies the Account Verification Process Owner about the issue. A meeting is arranged involving the QA Manager, Process Owner, and Operations Team Lead to discuss the findings and implications.</li>
    <li><strong>Collaborative Response:</strong> During the meeting, the team develops a corrective action plan. This may include retraining staff, updating procedures, or temporarily increasing the frequency of QA reviews for the area of concern.</li>
    <li><strong>Follow-Up:</strong> The QA Team Lead/Manager oversees the implementation of the action plan and tracks progress. The Process Owner is kept informed of the outcomes and signs off once satisfied that the issue is resolved.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Scenario 3: Critical Issues or Persistent Problems – Escalation to Senior Management</h3>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Trigger:</strong> Critical issues (e.g., a severe compliance violation, fraud indicators, or issues that remain unresolved across multiple QA cycles) are detected, or recurring major issues indicate a systemic problem.</li>
    <li><strong>Initial Action:</strong> QA Team Lead/Manager immediately alerts senior management (e.g., the Head of Operations or Quality Assurance Director) about the critical findings. The Process Owner is also informed that a high-level escalation is in process.</li>
    <li><strong>Escalation:</strong> Senior management convenes an urgent review or task force to investigate the issue. This group may include the QA Manager, Process Owner, Operations Lead, and representatives from Compliance or Risk Management if applicable.</li>
    <li><strong>Immediate Measures:</strong> Depending on the severity, senior management might temporarily halt certain account verification activities or implement emergency controls to contain risk while the issue is being investigated.</li>
    <li><strong>Resolution Plan:</strong> A comprehensive remediation plan is developed with clear ownership and deadlines (e.g., a process overhaul, additional training, or system controls to prevent recurrence). Senior management assigns specific leaders to implement these actions.</li>
    <li><strong>Communication:</strong> All stakeholders, including possibly the wider department or external regulators (if relevant), are kept informed about the issue and the steps being taken. Transparency is maintained throughout to ensure trust in the process.</li>
    <li><strong>Follow-Up:</strong> Senior management monitors the execution of the remediation plan closely. The QA Team Lead/Manager provides frequent updates. Once the issue is fully resolved and necessary changes are in place, a post-mortem meeting is held to document lessons learned and to update the QA review process or RACI roles if needed.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Recommendations for Enhanced Visibility, Controls, and Ownership</h2>
  <p>In light of the QA review process and the observed escalation scenarios, several improvements are recommended to strengthen the overall system. These recommendations aim to increase visibility into the QA process, tighten process controls to prevent issues, and clarify ownership to ensure accountability at all levels. Implementing these changes will help sustain the quality and efficiency of the account verification process after migration to the Powai CoE.</p>

  <h3>Enhanced Visibility</h3>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Regular Reporting:</strong> Implement a monthly QA report or dashboard that is shared with all stakeholders (QA team, Operations team, Process Owner, and senior management). The report should highlight key metrics such as the number of accounts reviewed, error rates, types of errors found, and trends over time.</li>
    <li><strong>Review Meetings:</strong> Schedule periodic review meetings (e.g., monthly or quarterly) where QA findings and trends are presented and discussed. This promotes transparency and allows the Operations team and Process Owner to stay informed and engaged with the QA outcomes.</li>
    <li><strong>Real-Time Visibility:</strong> Consider using a centralized tracking tool or platform where QA observations and corrective actions are logged. Stakeholders can access this tool to view the status of any issues in real time, which enhances trust and responsiveness.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Strengthened Controls</h3>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Standardized Procedures:</strong> Update and enforce a standardized account verification checklist for the Operations team, and a corresponding QA checklist for the QA Analyst. Ensuring both teams follow checklists reduces variability and oversight errors.</li>
    <li><strong>Training &amp; Development:</strong> Use insights from QA reviews to inform training sessions for the Operations team. For example, if QA finds recurring errors in a certain area, conduct refresher training or coaching on that topic to prevent future occurrences.</li>
    <li><strong>Process Audits:</strong> In addition to QA reviews, consider periodic process audits by an independent team to double-check compliance and control effectiveness in the account verification process. This adds another layer of control and can catch issues that daily QA might miss.</li>
    <li><strong>Automation of Controls:</strong> Where possible, integrate system controls or automated checks into the account verification process (for example, system flags for missing documentation). Automation can reduce human error and ensure critical steps are not bypassed.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Clear Ownership and Accountability</h3>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Designated QA Coordinator:</strong> Assign a specific coordinator or point-person within the Powai CoE QA team who is responsible for overseeing the entire QA review process and ensuring that all findings are addressed. This role would liaise between the QA team and the Operations team for any follow-ups.</li>
    <li><strong>Accountability in Performance Goals:</strong> Incorporate QA performance metrics (such as error rates or QA timeliness) into the performance goals of both the QA team and the Operations team leads. When teams are measured on quality outcomes, they are more likely to take ownership of the results and improvements.</li>
    <li><strong>Governance and Oversight:</strong> Establish a governance mechanism (e.g., a quarterly oversight committee meeting) involving the QA Manager, Process Owner, and senior management to review the QA process effectiveness. This ensures that leadership is accountable for supporting the QA process with necessary resources and that any barriers are promptly addressed.</li>
    <li><strong>RACI Updates:</strong> As the process evolves, periodically revisit and update the RACI matrix to reflect any changes in roles or responsibilities. Ensure that any changes are communicated to all stakeholders so that everyone remains clear on who owns each part of the process.</li>
  </ul>
