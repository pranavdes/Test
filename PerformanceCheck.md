## 7. Considerations for the Committee *(no recommendation implied)*  

* Multiple accommodations and repeat training yielded limited sustainable improvement.  
* Documented policy breaches compound performance concerns.

* The **9 Jul 2025** meeting is positioned as a final review; clarity on acceptable performance/conduct thresholds and potential consequences will aid determination of next steps.
