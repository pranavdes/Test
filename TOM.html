  <h1>AV QAR Operating Model Framework</h1>
  <hr>

  <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
  
  <h3>Purpose</h3>
  <p>Document the Operating Model Framework for the Powai Center of Excellence for the AV QAR process.</p>
  
  <h3>Objectives</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Achieve the firm-wide goal of standardisation and globalisation of the AV QAR process within the Control &amp; Oversight team.</li>
    <li>Optimise resource efficiencies through streamlined resource utilisation.</li>
    <li>Enhance operational resilience.</li>
    <li>Consolidate best practices across regions.</li>
  </ul>
  
  <h3>Context &amp; Background</h3>
  <p>
    <strong>AV QAR (Account Verification Quality Assurance Review)</strong> is a process run across all regions as a control to further strengthen the Global AV Policy. Currently, the process is executed in a siloed manner with varying process implementations and policy interpretations across regions. This results in:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Confusion among controllers who must prepare different substantiations and supporting documents for similar account types.</li>
    <li>Inconsistencies in account gradings, leading to queries regarding cross-region differences.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    The directive from FOC to standardise and globalise processes—and to utilise Powai as a hub—has guided the development of the proposed Powai Center of Excellence Hub and Spoke Model.
  </p>

  <h2>2. Operating Model Overview</h2>
  
  <h3>Current vs. Proposed State</h3>
  
  <h4>Current Structure</h4>
  <p><strong>Regions Involved:</strong> Japan, AeJ (Asia excluding Japan), EMEA, and US.</p>
  <p><strong>Reporting Lines:</strong></p>
  <ul>
    <li>Powai Regional Leads report to the Powai Global Lead.</li>
    <li>Regional Leads work with Regional Counterparts (Regional Control &amp; Oversight Heads or their delegates reporting to Regional CFOs).</li>
    <li>The Powai Global Lead reports to the Powai COO (also the Powai C&amp;O Head), who in turn reports to the Powai CFO.</li>
  </ul>
  <p><strong>Team Allocation:</strong></p>
  <ul>
    <li>Japan: ~150 hours/month</li>
    <li>AeJ: ~250 hours/month</li>
    <li>EMEA: ~200 hours/month</li>
    <li>US: ~120 hours/month</li>
    <li><strong>Total:</strong> Approximately 3.8 FTEs dedicated to the AV QAR process.</li>
  </ul>
  
  <p><strong>Current Organizational Structure:</strong></p>
  <pre>
|- Brijesh Ahuja (Powai C&O Head) (Management Allocation across regions)
    |-- Pranav Desai (Global C&O Powai Lead) (Management Allocation across regions)
        |--- Anamika Barnwal (Japan C&O Lead - Allocation 50% [~80% AV QAR, i.e. 40% of total FTE])

               - Role: AV QAR Co-Lead (Allocation 90%)
               - Also serves as Japan C&O Lead (Allocation 10%)
               |---- Ashita Audichya (AV QAR Team Member - Allocation 100%)
